# Does Team Success Equal Larger Attendance?


## Problem
* This project will seek to determine if the success of an NBA team has an impact on the attendance of home games throughout the season. The attendance of games is a good indicator of hometown support for the teams and also may give insight to if people are spending their money to watch their teams play. 

##Client
* A goal of any NBA team owner is to generate as much profit as possible and the goal of any NBA team executive is to be as competitive as possible. If a positive correlation between a team's wins and game attendance was found, it would be in everyone's best interests to assemble and put forth competitive teams. If it is found that a successful team draws larger crowds to games and in turn, increases revenue, owners of NBA teams would be incentivized to want to improve their teams. 
    + NBA team owners may find the results of this project relevant and may not settle for having a mediocre team. If having one of the top teams in the NBA mean bringing in an increased number of people to games, then owners may push team executives to build upper echelon teams.
    + In turn, team executives may use the data and results to impress their team owners and ensure job security. By putting together an impressive team and bringing in increased attendance, the owner of the team may look favorably upon the executive.

##Data
* A dataset of game attendance for each NBA team from the year 2000-2015 will be compared to another dataset showing the win totals of each respective team. The dataset containing the attendance of the NBA teams already exists and will be used for the project. The dataset containing each team's win total during the 15 year span will be produced manually in order to facilitate the merging of both datasets. 

##Method
* By running analysis of this data, we will be able to see if the better teams of the NBA bring in larger crowds than the struggling teams.  By analyzing the trends during a 15 year period, this will bolster validity of the findings. We can just compare the win totals of each team and see if the attendance rates follow a significant pattern or we can also specifically highlight a single NBA team and follow their course over the 15 year span.
